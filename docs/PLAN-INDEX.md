# Sprint & Milestone Index

Master index of all planned and completed milestones. Unique numbering — no duplicates, no ambiguity.

**Last completed:** Progress Page series + Pipeline Flow rework (PRs #104–#129, 2026-04-14 to 2026-04-15)
**Last shipped:** M19 (Project Ownership, 2026-03-31). **28 commits accumulated on `dev` since**, not yet promoted to `main` — PR #126 (dev→main) intentionally closed to batch, plus PR #129 still open on top.
**Next up:** Fundraising glossary conversation → F1/F2/F3 stage-schema-drift fixes → M20 (Task Requests) + Sprint B

## Execution Order & Dependencies

```
M9  ✅  Schema Qualification
M10 ✅  Activities Foundation (backend)
M11 ✅  Pebble PostgreSQL Migration
M12 ✅  Pebble Access Control
M18 ✅  Project Soft-Delete
 │
 ├──► M13 (Activities Timeline)  ──┐
 │    Session 1: Timeline component │
 │    Session 2: Detail modals      ├──► M16 (Integration + QA)
 ├──► M15 (Chrome Extension) ──────┘    (wiring + regression)
 │    Session 1: Manifest + scripts
 │    Session 2: Popup + flows
 ├──► M17 (SF Audit + Prospect CRM) ✅ ← 3 sessions, absorbs M14
 │    Session 1: Schema + validation + storage ✅
 │    Session 2: T1-T3 pipeline + persistence ✅
 │    Session 3: Drift detection + integration test ✅
 ├──► M19 (Project Ownership)         ← 1 session, deferred from M8
 └──► M20 (Task Request System)      ← 2 sessions, post-launch
      Session 1: Backend (table + API + permissions)
      Session 2: Frontend (notifications + modal + status)
```

**M13 and M15 are unblocked** and can run in parallel (both depend only on M10 ✅). M16 depends on both M13 + M15. **M14 has been absorbed into M17** — the SF describe() audit resolved the field definition blocker. **M20 depends on permission profile setup** (Sprint A, pre-launch) — PM profile must exist before task request endpoints can be gated.

Parallel with M13 (no frontend dependency). |
| **M16: Activities Integration + QA** | `tasks/sprint9-activities-extension-plan.md` (9D section) | M13 + M15 | S (1 session) | Planned | Wire modals into pages, global search, full regression. Worktree for safety. |
