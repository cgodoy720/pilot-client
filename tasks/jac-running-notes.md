## Scope expansion 2026-04-20

JP expanded scope on 2026-04-20 from "ship B3 and move on" to "get all 5 core SF objects (Opportunities, Accounts, Contacts, Tasks, Activities) production-ready using real SF schemas — no shortcuts." See `tasks/objects-production-readiness-plan.md` for the full verified inventory + 23-PR sequence (#147-#169, including a page-rename cleanup at #148). B3 and B6 absorbed into PRs #149-#151; B4 splits into PRs #161-#165; B5, B7-B9 become PRs #166-#169.

## Launch pacing

Original target Wed 2026-04-22 is deferred. JP: *"We have time to do this correctly, so ignore time constraints. … production-ready for MVP sprint."* New cadence: each PR in the plan sequence ships production-ready before the next starts. Per-PR status tracked in the plan doc's "PR sequence" table.

## Pending actions on your side (Jac)

1. **Run the B1 migration against the shared segundo-db.** Idempotent — safe to re-run.
   ```bash
   psql "$DATABASE_URL" -f financial_forecasting/db/migrations/2026-04-19-add-manage-owner-goals-permission.sql
   ```
   Verify:
   ```sql
   SELECT name, permissions->>'manage_owner_goals' FROM bedrock.permission_profile ORDER BY name;
   ```
   Expected: `Admin=true, Executive=true, Relationship Manager=null, Project Manager=null`. Without this migration, `Executive` users still 403 on target edits even though PR #142 is merged — the `init.sql` seeds use `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`, so existing rows aren't auto-updated.

2. **Confirm `DATABASE_URL` is set in the deployed backend's `.env`.** PR #142 removed the `postgresql://bedrock@localhost:5432/bedrock` fallback. If `DATABASE_URL` is unset or empty, the backend refuses to start — `init_db` logs a clear error, pool stays `None`, every DB route returns 503. Intentional, but means the production deploy must have the env var explicitly set.

## Progress log (newest first)

### 2026-04-21 — Lane A3 shipped (PR #158) 👀 in review

- **Why.** The Settings → Progress Visibility feature (BUG-UI-19) was ripped from the frontend in PR #139 (2026-04-21). The backend router (`routes/progress_tracking.py`), its test suite (`tests/test_progress_tracking.py`), and the `bedrock.progress_tracked_override` table were deliberately left orphaned at that time, to be pruned "once we've confirmed no external caller depends on them" (per `tasks/pr-139-qa-bugs.md:239-240`). Verification via repo-wide grep in this PR found zero callers (FE, backend, config, or init.sql). Leaving the router registered means `/api/progress-tracking/*` keeps responding 200 on GET with no consumer — surface area for no benefit. This PR completes the teardown.
- **Fix (backend).** `main.py` unregister (delete lines 44 + 120 — the import + `include_router` call). `git rm routes/progress_tracking.py` (149 LOC, 2 endpoints: `GET /api/progress-tracking/users` auth-gated and `PUT /api/progress-tracking/overrides/{sf_user_id}` admin-gated). `git rm tests/test_progress_tracking.py` (236 LOC, 9 tests across 2 classes — `TestGetProgressTrackedUsers` 4 tests, `TestPutOverride` 5 tests). NEW `db/migrations/2026-04-21-drop-progress-tracked-override.sql` — idempotent `DROP TABLE IF EXISTS bedrock.progress_tracked_override` wrapped in `BEGIN; … COMMIT;`, schema-qualified per `feedback_schema_qualify_sql`. No CASCADE — the ADD migration created only the table + PK index + 3 COMMENT ON rows, all of which drop implicitly with the table; no dependent views/FKs/triggers per verification against the 2026-04-15 ADD file.
- **Fix (frontend).** 5 BUG-UI-19 stale comments scrubbed across 3 files:
  - `services/api.ts:326-330` — delete 5-line tombstone block (endpoints gone, "do not re-add client methods" guidance moot).
  - `pages/Settings.tsx:223-226` — delete 4-line floating tombstone between unrelated mutations.
  - `pages/Settings.tsx:680-681` — delete 2-line JSX tombstone pointing at an already-removed useQuery.
  - `pages/Progress.tsx:~450` — trim parenthetical from `"(set by JP + Jac 2026-04-15; Progress Visibility override removed 2026-04-21, BUG-UI-19)"` → `"(set by JP + Jac 2026-04-15)"`. Preserves the 3-criteria filter architectural doc, drops the dated BUG-ID rot.
  - Intentionally untouched: `pages/Progress.tsx:114-118` (comment above the live `sf-users-progress` useQuery — ongoing architectural value per JP).
- **Scope-expansion note.** Lane table originally listed 3 FE comments (`api.ts`, `Settings.tsx:680`, `Progress.tsx:~111-115`). Verification grep surfaced 2 additional BUG-UI-19 references (`Settings.tsx:223`, `Progress.tsx:450`). Per the standing directive to surface scope expansion, asked JP before widening: JP confirmed include both, and to leave `Progress.tsx:114-118` alone. Lane-table Touches field + numbering shift row updated in this PR diff to match.
- **Verification.**
  - `pytest tests/` → **20 failed, 718 passed, 22 skipped** (baseline post-#157: 20/727/22; delta −9 matches the 9 tests in deleted `test_progress_tracking.py` exactly — no regressions. The 20 failures are pre-existing in `test_sf_dependencies.py` per `tasks/remaining-32-test-failures-plan.md`).
  - `npx tsc --noEmit` clean (comment-only FE changes).
  - `rg -n "BUG-UI-19|progress-tracking|progress_tracked_override|progress_tracking" financial_forecasting/` → returns only expected hits: both migration files, `tests/test_api_endpoints.py:262` (reset_cache docstring — acknowledged out-of-scope), and `pages/Progress.tsx:115` (JP-preserved comment). Zero other hits.
- **Migration safety.** DROP migration is idempotent (`IF EXISTS`). Per JP 2026-04-21: not yet applied on segundo-db, so post-merge segundo-db behavior is unchanged. Local dev environments that applied the ADD migration will lose the table when the DROP migration runs; no cross-table cleanup needed.
- **Cross-lane note.** Parallel with Lane B3 `pr-dialog-audit-account` per Round 3 of the collision gate. Verified disjoint: A3 touches `main.py` (import + router registry region, far from B3's dialog region), `routes/progress_tracking.py`, `tests/test_progress_tracking.py`, Settings.tsx, Progress.tsx, api.ts, and a new migration file; B3 touches `AccountEditDialog.tsx` only. No shared files.
- **Numbering drift.** Plan docs estimated this PR at #177. Actual is **#158** (lanes interleaved: A1 #155, B1 #156, A2 #157, now A3 #158). `tasks/parallel-pr-lanes.md` numbering shift table + Lane A3 row updated to reflect the actual number.
- **Pending for you.** Review PR #158 (1 new migration, 2 file deletes, small diffs in `main.py` + 3 FE files + 2 doc files). Post-merge: optionally apply the DROP migration to any local dev DB that has the table (`psql "$DATABASE_URL" -f db/migrations/2026-04-21-drop-progress-tracked-override.sql`). No action needed for segundo-db — table never existed there.

### 2026-04-21 — Lane A2 shipped (PR #157) 👀 in review

- **Why.** `data_sync.py::sync_activities()` at lines 55-162 mirrors SF Tasks + Events into `bedrock.activity` (Sprint 9A impl already landed in commit `a7a...`). `tests/test_activities.py` has HTTP-layer coverage (sync_count, sync_trigger, sync_status) but never exercised the service-layer mapping + upsert + control-flow logic. Next refactor of `_map_sf_task` / `_map_sf_event` / `_upsert_activity` could silently mis-mirror production data.
- **Fix.** New `financial_forecasting/tests/test_activity_sync.py` — 54 tests across 5 classes, 607 LOC:
  1. `TestParseSfDatetime` (8) — Salesforce date/datetime parsing + UTC-aware-out invariants.
  2. `TestMapSfTask` (19) — email/call/note type decision, WhatId 006/001 routing, WhoId 003 routing, call-duration sec→min conversion, identity preservation, ActivityDate fallback to CreatedDate.
  3. `TestMapSfEvent` (11) — IsAllDayEvent → calendar-event vs meeting, WhatId/WhoId routing mirrored, Location → meeting_location, DurationInMinutes direct (NOT divided unlike Task's seconds), StartDateTime fallback.
  4. `TestUpsertActivity` (4) — `"INSERT 0 1"` → "upserted", `"INSERT 0 0"` → "skipped_deleted", `deleted_at IS NULL` guard in SQL, 15 positional params in correct order.
  5. `TestSyncActivitiesRoundTrip` (12) — skips when no db_pool / no SF, queries both objects, processes mixed batch (3 Tasks + 2 Events → 5 upserts), watermark-in-SOQL only when prior rows exist, soft-deleted counted separately, survives per-row mapping error + per-query failure, history entry shape.
  - Pins **all 5 plan canonical cases** (email subtype → email, call type → call, all-day → calendar-event, WhatId 006/001, soft-delete preservation).
- **Bugs found during test-writing.** Zero. The landed impl held up on every invariant. `data_sync.py` unchanged.
- **Verification.**
  - `pytest tests/` → **20 failed, 727 passed, 22 skipped** (baseline 20/673/22 post-#155; delta +54 matches new test count exactly — no regressions).
  - `pytest tests/test_activity_sync.py -v` → 54/54 pass in 0.05s.
  - Segundo-db spot-check: 6039 rows in `bedrock.activity` (JP ran queries locally).
- **Cross-lane note.** Parallel with Lane B1 `pr-use-schema-picklist` (JP's worktree, merged as #156). Fully disjoint — new test file + new hook file. No collision.
- **Pending for you.** Review PR #157. Manual segundo-db smoke post-merge (trigger sync via `/api/activities/sync/trigger`, spot-check row count + synced_at delta).

### 2026-04-21 — Lane B1 schema-picklist hook shipped (PR #156) 👀 in review

- **Why.** Four downstream dialog-audit PRs (B2 Opportunity, B3 Account, B4 Contact, B6 TaskPanel) all need to replace hardcoded `FALLBACK_TYPES` / `OPPORTUNITY_STAGES` / `FALLBACK_SALUTATIONS` / etc. arrays with live Salesforce picklist data — otherwise a Stage/Type rename in SF silently drifts from the frontend until someone notices. Lane B1 ships the shared hook so each dialog-audit PR downstream can stay focused on UI conversion instead of reimplementing caching/dedupe/active-filter logic. No user-visible change in this PR.
- **Fix.** NEW `frontend/src/hooks/useSchemaPicklist.ts` — signature `useSchemaPicklist(sobject: string, fieldName: string) → { options: string[], isLoading, error }`. Backed by `apiService.getSchemaDescribe(sobject)` (the existing `/api/salesforce/schema/:sobject` endpoint, no backend change). React-query v3 cache keyed on `['schema-picklist', sobject, fieldName]`, 30-min staleTime, `retry: 1`, defensive envelope access (`res.data?.data?.fields ?? res.data?.fields ?? []`) so both current-raw and legacy-wrapped response shapes work. Filters to active-only values, dedupes via `Set`, sorts lexicographically. Graceful-empty on every failure path (error, field-missing, non-picklist field, all-inactive). Mirrors `useOpportunityRecordTypes.ts` structure verbatim.
- **Tests.** NEW `useSchemaPicklist.test.tsx` — 7 cases: happy path, field-absent, non-picklist field, all-inactive, dedupe, API-rejection (asserts `retry: 1` fires = 2 total calls), defensive envelope. Inline per-test fresh `QueryClient` wrapper (`retry: false, cacheTime: 0, staleTime: 0`) pattern is new for this repo — first react-query hook to have direct unit tests. First-hit gotcha: hook's `retry: 1` overrides the QueryClient default `retry: false`, so the rejection test needed `waitFor({ timeout: 5000 })` and to wait on `error` directly (not `isLoading`, which stays `true` during the ~1s retry backoff). Documented inline in the test.
- **Verification.**
  - `npx tsc --noEmit` clean.
  - `CI=true npm test -- src/hooks/useSchemaPicklist` — 7/7 pass (2.16s).
  - `CI=true npm test --watchAll=false` — **25/25 suites, 367/367 tests pass.** Zero regressions. (Pre-existing babel parse error at `utils/fieldSensitivity.test.ts:114` noted in PR #142 entry is no longer surfacing — appears fixed in a later PR.)
  - Backend pytest not re-run: no Python changes in this PR.
- **Scope discipline.** I did **not** retire `useOpportunityTypePicklist` as a thin wrapper even though the original plan doc (`objects-production-readiness-plan.md` PR #153 section) called for it — Lane A4 (`pr-opp-type-deprecation`) deletes it cleanly along with `TypeCell`, grid column, `PipelineFilterBar` type filter, and the `main.py` Type references. Touching it here would duplicate A4's work. Plan doc updated in this PR to note the divergence.
- **Numbering drift.** Plan doc expected B1 at #160 and A1 at #155. A1 landed at #155 on-schedule; B1 opens right after at #156 (−4 from plan estimate). `tasks/parallel-pr-lanes.md` "Numbering shift" table and Lane B header updated accordingly; later Lane B slots will shift as lanes continue to interleave.
- **Worktree workflow.** Built in a `git worktree` at `/Users/jp/Desktop/pursuit-financial-forecasting-B1` so A1's in-flight `main.py` edits in the primary checkout were never touched. After A1 merged, rebased onto the new `origin/dev` HEAD `79741e0` — no conflicts (different files). `node_modules` symlinked from primary (A1 didn't touch frontend deps, safe). Post-merge: `git worktree remove /Users/jp/Desktop/pursuit-financial-forecasting-B1` + branch delete.
- **Unblocks.** Lane B2/B3/B4/B6 can now import `{ useSchemaPicklist }` and convert dialogs. Each lands as a separate small PR per the parallel-lanes table.
- **Pending for you.** Review PR #156 diff (2 new files in `hooks/` + 3 doc updates). No migrations, no env changes, no backend changes, no user-visible UI change.

### 2026-04-21 — Lane A1 shipped (PR #155) 👀 in review

- **Why.** Four Salesforce list endpoints in `main.py` used single-page `salesforce.query()` with a hard SOQL `LIMIT`: once the real row count exceeds 2000 (accounts, contacts, opp-tasks) or 500 (my-tasks), results silently truncate — no error, no pagination header, no client signal. Latent correctness bug that hasn't yet bitten at Pursuit's ~1k-row scale but would the moment any collection grows past its cap. `get_opportunities` was fixed in PR #68 (2026-03-25); this PR propagates the same pattern to the remaining 4 endpoints.
- **Fix (backend).** Mirror `get_opportunities` at `main.py:304-375` exactly:
  - `get_contacts` + `get_accounts` + `get_opportunity_tasks` → `limit: Optional[int] = Query(None, le=...)`, conditional `LIMIT` clause, `salesforce.query_all()` for automatic SOQL pagination. Cache keys now `f"...:{limit or 'all'}"`. Accounts kept `le=2000`; contacts kept `le=5000`; opp-tasks newly gains `le=2000` (had no param before).
  - `get_my_tasks` stays on `salesforce.query()` — the WHERE clause (`IsClosed = false` + optional per-user date range) scope-bounds counts well under any realistic cap. Default bumped 200 → 2000, `le=500` → `le=2000` to accommodate heavy users. Explicit MVP-scale assumption: if any single user's open-Task count ever crosses 2000, switch to `query_all()` in a follow-up.
- **Tests.** 14 new + 5 existing updated, covering:
  - Contacts / Accounts: `query` → `query_all` mock update + new `paginates_beyond_2000` test (mock 2500 records, assert full passthrough + no `LIMIT` in SOQL).
  - Opportunity-tasks: full-suite (returns-list, paginates-beyond-2000, limit-validation at `le=2000`).
  - My-tasks: **defensive 9-test suite** per JP direction — returns-list, empty, date-range variants (both/none/start/end), default-limit=2000 guard, cap-at-2000 validation, `query` vs `query_all` guard (pins the intentional non-pagination decision), `IsClosed = false` guard (pins the scope-bounding assumption that makes single-page safe), service-error propagation.
  - Fixture hygiene: added `service.query_all = AsyncMock(return_value={"records": []})` to both `tests/conftest.py::mock_salesforce_service` and `tests/test_api_endpoints.py::mock_salesforce` so future callers get a safe default instead of an auto-generated child AsyncMock.
- **Frontend comment trim (bundled per JP).** Two comments in `OpportunityEditDialog.tsx:269` and `inline-edit/cells/AccountCell.tsx:22` referenced the pre-fix "truncates at 2000 rows alphabetically" state and named this PR by slug. Tightened both to describe the defensive fallback's ongoing purpose (transient pre-load / fetch-error states) without the stale truncation claim. Comment-only — no prop types, JSX, or logic changed. `npx tsc --noEmit` clean.
- **Verification.**
  - `pytest tests/` → **20 failed, 673 passed, 22 skipped** (baseline pre-change: 20 failed, 659 passed, 22 skipped; delta +14 matches new test count exactly; the 20 failures are all pre-existing in `test_sf_dependencies.py` — tracked in `tasks/remaining-32-test-failures-plan.md`).
  - `npx tsc --noEmit` clean.
  - `git diff --stat origin/dev`: 207+ / 41− = 166 net LOC across 5 files (S-M bucket per plan estimate).
- **Cross-lane note.** Lane B1 (`pr-use-schema-picklist`) ran in parallel with disjoint files (new hook file vs. backend list endpoints). Round 1 of the collision gate holds.
- **Pending for you.** Review PR #155. No migrations, no env changes.

### 2026-04-21 — Singleton-race fix shipped (PR #153) 🚧 in review

- **Why.** Two-pass verification of Jac's PR #151 (2026-04-21) surfaced that BUG-AUTH-2's fix in `dependencies.py::get_mcp_client` mutates `client.services["salesforce"]` and `client._connected_services` in place on every cookie-bearing request. Combined with the `lambda: self.sf_client.query(soql)` capture pattern across all 8 CRUD methods in `mcp_client/services/salesforce.py`, two concurrent requests from different users could race on the shared `sf_client` reference → User A's in-flight SOQL executes against User B's session. Jac's own QA tracker (`tasks/pr-139-qa-bugs.md:32-35`) named the right fix verbatim; the implementation had diverged.
- **Fix.** Added `_PerRequestMCPClient(UnifiedMCPClient)` subclass in `dependencies.py`. On each cookie-bearing request, `get_mcp_client` now builds a fresh `SalesforceMCPService` from the decrypted cookie and wraps it in `_PerRequestMCPClient` whose `__init__` copies the base's `services` dict + `_connected_services` list (no mutation of the singleton) and overrides the SF slot. The inherited `@property` accessors (`.salesforce`, `.connected_services`) resolve through the copied attrs. Non-cookie path returns the base client unchanged — service-account path (background sync, forecasting_engine, data_sync) preserved.
- **Tests.** New `tests/test_per_request_sf_client.py` — 9 tests covering: no cookie → base returned, invalid cookie → base returned, missing-tokens cookie → base returned, valid cookie → wrapper with fresh SF service, wrapper builds SF from cookie when base has no SF, **base singleton never mutated after 3 distinct-cookie requests** (the critical invariant), services-dict isolation, connected_services-list isolation, concurrent `asyncio.gather` requests get distinct `SalesforceMCPService` instances.
- **Verification.** `pytest tests/` — 658 passed, 20 failed (same 20 pre-existing failures in `test_projects_endpoints.py` / `test_sf_dependencies.py` / `test_mcp_services.py` / `test_permissions.py` per `tasks/remaining-32-test-failures-plan.md`). Baseline was 649 passed; +9 matches exactly the new test count. No regressions. No frontend changes.
- **Numbering.** Plan's original `#149` → actual `#153` after Jac's `#151` + rollups `#150, #152` took intermediate numbers. All downstream PR numbers in `tasks/objects-production-readiness-plan.md` shift by +4. See `tasks/parallel-pr-lanes.md` for the authoritative current sequence.
- **Unblocks.** Lanes A and B can now run in parallel per `tasks/parallel-pr-lanes.md`. Next PRs: Lane A `#154 pr-contacts-accounts-pagination`, Lane B `#159 pr-use-schema-picklist`.
- **Pending for you.** Review PR #153 diff (dependencies.py + new test file). No migrations, no env changes, no frontend impact.

### 2026-04-20 — Page-rename cleanup shipped (PR #148)

- **Why.** PR #147 plan-verification surfaced a file/component name drift: the **Priorities** sidebar entry routed to `pages/MyDashboard.tsx` (component inside was `const MyDashboard`), and the **Progress** sidebar entry routed to `pages/Overview.tsx` (component inside was already correctly named `Progress`, but file name was stale — asymmetric).
- **Fix.** `git mv MyDashboard.tsx → Priorities.tsx` with matching `const`/`export` rename; `git mv Overview.tsx → Progress.tsx` (file-rename only — internal `const Progress` unchanged). `App.tsx` import + JSX call sites updated. Also cleaned up 7 cross-file comment/doc references that repo-grep surfaced during verification so they point at the new file names (`env.production.template`, `DEV_SETUP_GUIDE.md`, `Opportunities.tsx`, `WeeklyCalendar.tsx`, `Layout.tsx`, `COMPREHENSIVE_DATA_FIX.md`, `README.md`).
- **Routes unchanged.** `/priorities` and `/dashboard` stay stable — no bookmark impact.
- **Intentionally untouched.** Inside the new `Progress.tsx`, the user-visible "Current FY Overview" heading is semantic English (not a component reference) — left alone.
- **Verification.** `npx tsc --noEmit` clean; `CI=true npm test -- --watchAll=false` no new failures; manual smoke on `/priorities` + `/dashboard` — page-identity headers (rendered by `Layout` from `currentMenuItem.text`) unchanged.
- **Pending for you.** None.

### 2026-04-20 — Scope expanded; master plan opened as PR #147

- **Context.** From B3 investigation (see below): Reports-page "500-row cap" turned out to be a mix of real (Contacts backend uses `query()` not `query_all()`) and perceptual (Opportunities backend already correct since 2026-03-25; the user-visible symptom was pageSize=500 + stage-filter masking). Fixing only Contacts wasn't enough.
- **JP direction (2026-04-20).** "We need all the key objects listed here, Opportunities, Accounts, Contacts, Tasks, and Activities (ignore Leads as an object for Reports for MVP). We need edit dialogs to work throughout the site, not just fix the caps on Report page. … We have time to do this correctly, so ignore time constraints. … real SF schemas, not your guesses. … DO NOT DO ANY SHORTCUTS!"
- **Inventory.** Three parallel Explore agents ran a full audit: backend list + write endpoints per object, frontend list pages + row-count captions, edit dialogs + gap analysis. Verified directly against `origin/dev` HEAD `17732d3`.
- **Master plan.** `tasks/objects-production-readiness-plan.md` — 23-PR sequence (#147 through #169, with a page-rename cleanup at #148) organized by risk and dependency. Each PR production-ready on its own. Leads drops from Reports for MVP; Activities takes its place.
- **This PR (#147)** ships docs only: the plan itself, plus supersession banners across `tasks/mvp-launch-sprint.md`, `tasks/accounts-endpoint-pagination-followup.md`, `tasks/sprint9-activities-extension-plan.md`, this file, and `tasks/handoff-prompt.md`.
- **Pending for you.** Review the plan (~10 min read). Approve PR #147. Then PR #148 (`pr-page-rename-cleanup`) is the next concrete code PR — a small file/component rename to align `pages/MyDashboard.tsx` → `pages/Priorities.tsx` and `pages/Overview.tsx` → `pages/Progress.tsx` with their sidebar labels, before any larger code work touches those files.

### 2026-04-19 — B2 shipped (PR #144)

- **Problem.** From the 2026-04-17 session (~9:21–9:55): you looked up Mercy Corps for Data in Bedrock and expected to see its `Type` value. Salesforce has `Type = 'Other fee for service'` (you confirmed in the SF UI). Bedrock showed nothing. JP flagged: "type is not pulling in correctly."
- **Root cause.** The backend correctly queried and returned Type — verified at `main.py:333` (SELECT includes Type), `main.py:365–371` (records returned raw), `services/crm_parser.py:23–27` (cache stores raw). Frontend type definitions included Type at `types/salesforce.ts:129` and `pages/Opportunities/helpers.ts:69`. The bug was purely display-side: **no grid exposed a Type column**, and no filter targeted it. Users could only see/edit Type by opening the full-edit drawer per-record. Also caught: the test factory (`conftest.py:make_sf_opportunity`) had no Type default, so no test ever round-tripped Type — the regression was invisible to CI.
- **Fix.** JP's chosen scope: "everything + inline-edit column like Stage." Single PR:
  1. New hook `useOpportunityTypePicklist.ts` — react-query fetch of `/api/salesforce/schema/Opportunity` picklist, 30-min cache, graceful empty-on-error fallback.
  2. New `TypeCell.tsx` — mirrors `StageCell` pattern. Renders a neutral-pill inline-edit select. Falls back to read-only plain text when the picklist fetch fails.
  3. `buildPipelineColumns` — new Type column between Stage and Amount, using TypeCell.
  4. `buildPaymentColumns` — new Type column (read-only) between Account and Close Date; Finance view is scan-oriented so no inline-edit.
  5. `PipelineFilterBar.tsx` — new `types` field on `PipelineFilters`, new Autocomplete in the expanded drawer, active-filter chip when set.
  6. `OpportunityEditDialog.tsx:498` — free-text TextField upgraded to select-variant TextField populated from the shared picklist hook. Falls back to free-text if the picklist is empty. Inactive-but-current-value is shown as disabled "(inactive)" so users don't silently lose a value.
  7. `Accounts.tsx:627+` opportunity-detail columns — new read-only Type column between Stage and Amount.
  8. `conftest.py:make_sf_opportunity` — Type now defaults to `"Other fee for service"` so all factory-derived tests exercise Type by default.
  9. `test_api_endpoints.py:test_get_opportunities_returns_records` — new assertion `data[0]["Type"] == "Other fee for service"` guards the API contract.
- **Verification.** Frontend typecheck clean. Full test suite no new failures. Visual check against shared DB: Type column renders, picklist dropdown populates, filter works, edit dialog select replaces the free-text field.
- **Pending for you.** None. Pure frontend PR; no migration, no env change.

### 2026-04-19 — B1 shipped (PR #142)

- **Problem.** From the 2026-04-17 session (~44:01–47:27): your shared-DB query showed only the two targets you'd set yourself — JP's never arrived, despite his session displaying them as saved.
- **Root causes, all verified against source:**
  1. `db.py:37` silently fell back to local Postgres on missing `DATABASE_URL`. JP's local backend wrote to localhost while teammates read from the shared segundo-db.
  2. Permission-key mismatch: backend `owner_goals.py:106` gated on `manage_owner_goals`; frontend used `manage_targets` at 5 sites — a permission key that is not in `PERMISSION_KEYS` and therefore never resolves to `true`. Admin bypassed this via the `isAdmin` check.
  3. Admin + Executive profile seeds in `init.sql:392–425, 469–508` omitted `manage_owner_goals`. Worked for Admin via runtime `setdefault` auto-grant; Execs had no fallback and silently 403'd.
  4. `test_owner_goals.py` mock used the stale query pattern `"FROM bedrock.app_user"` (refactored to `public.org_users`) and omitted `profile_id` from mocked rows — every permission-gated test silently 403'd.
- **Fix.** Single PR, 9 files, +211 / −15. Fail-fast on `DATABASE_URL`; rename frontend `manage_targets` → `manage_owner_goals` (5 sites); add the key explicitly to Admin + Executive seeds; new migration to apply the grant to already-seeded shared-DB rows; fix stale mock; new `tests/test_db_init.py` (3 tests) covering the fail-fast guard.
- **Verification results.**
  - `pytest tests/test_db_init.py tests/test_owner_goals.py` → 17/17 pass (3 new + 14 previously silently-403'ing).
  - Full suite: baseline 32 failed, 634 passed → after 20 failed, 649 passed. Net +15: 3 new tests + 12 test_owner_goals.py tests now actually exercising their intended flow.
  - Fail-fast smoke (`env -u DATABASE_URL python3 -c "..."`): clear error, status `disconnected`, no `asyncpg` call.
  - Frontend `npx tsc --noEmit` clean.
- **Caveats.**
  - Pre-existing babel parse error at `frontend/src/utils/fieldSensitivity.test.ts:114` — confirmed on baseline via `git stash`, not introduced here. Out of scope for this fix; should be a separate PR.
  - 20 remaining test failures are all in `test_projects_endpoints.py` + `test_sf_dependencies.py`, tracked at `tasks/remaining-32-test-failures-plan.md`.

## Tuesday 2026-04-21 pair-build plan

From the 2026-04-17 session (57:04–57:43):
- **11:30** check-in (brief)
- **2:30–3:30** main working block (you moved the jobs PRD; Damon couldn't join)
- **4:00–5:00** final go/no-go after your Nick meeting

Monday night handoff: JP sends a state-of-the-world summary — what's shipped, what's in-flight, what's still open. You can pick up any item off the sprint plan from there.

## Pre-launch checklist

- [x] PR #139 dev → main rollup merged (2026-04-19)
- [x] B1 code shipped (PR #142)
- [ ] B1 migration applied to shared segundo-db (pending Jac action above)
- [ ] Deployed `DATABASE_URL` confirmed set (pending Jac action above)
- [x] B2 (opp Type field) shipped (PR #144, merged 2026-04-20)
- [ ] PR #147 planning PR merged
- [ ] PRs #148-#169 shipped per `tasks/objects-production-readiness-plan.md` sequence
- [ ] End-to-end workflow smoke test (from the meeting: "create an opportunity, create a contact, create a task, create an account, progress it all, change it all")
- [ ] Wall of Progress E2E: JP sets a target, Jac queries DB, target is present, target appears on Jac's Progress page after refresh
- [ ] All 5 core objects (Opportunities, Accounts, Contacts, Tasks, Activities) support: find (list returns all rows), edit (dialog covers workflow fields via real SF schema), organize (sort/filter/search)

## What's explicitly parked / deferred (agreed in session)

- **Drawer vs modal vs tab** for related-object editing — you: "This is not those edit things. Those edit things are going to be fine. We can change that later."
- **Progress-page "Wins" → "Closed" rename** — the semantic overload ("Closed Won" already means something specific) doesn't survive scrutiny. Dropped.
- **Pebble integration into Bedrock** — JP: "I need another week because we gotta roll out bedrock." Post-MVP.
- **Hackathon-style shortcut replacement for Nick's external tools** — JP: "let me, like, ship something. I've been working for weeks on this and I don't want to, like, hackathon it." Pebble proper ships after MVP.
- **RecordType filtering audit** across all frontend `getOpportunities()` callers — parked post-MVP v1 because MVP is philanthropy-only fundraisers. Full spec preserved at `tasks/recordtype-audit-post-mvp.md`.
- **Stage-list drift consolidation** (9 drift sites in Overview/Accounts/PaymentProcessing/Opportunities) — parked. Plan at `tasks/stage-list-drift-plan.md`. Partially dissolves into the RecordType audit once that ships.
- **`get_accounts` endpoint single-page → `query_all()`** — latent truncation bug if account count exceeds the cap. Tracked at `tasks/accounts-endpoint-pagination-followup.md`.
- **Remaining 32 test failures** in `test_projects_endpoints.py` + `test_sf_dependencies.py` + `test_mcp_services.py`. Plan at `tasks/remaining-32-test-failures-plan.md` (uses the closed PR #102's diagnostics as reference).

## Process notes from your side (adopting going forward)

- **PR = "I tested this and it's good,"** not "I built this, help me test it." JP is adopting this. Doc-only PRs are the exception you granted.
- **Consider Playwright for automated click-through tests** post-MVP. You already use this pattern at the factory.
- **"Put yourself in the CEO shoes"** — iterate tiny polish, page-by-page, before shipping. JP agreed to adopt after MVP goes out; pre-launch mode is build-fast to hit Wednesday.

## How this doc is maintained

- Updated **in the same PR diff** as each bug-fix that changes its status. No separate docs-churn PRs. This keeps the running log synchronized with the actual code state.
- Exception: this initial creation is its own small PR so it's visible right away.
- Newest entries at the top of the Progress log.
- Status table updates in-place as each bug moves across Queued → In Progress → Shipped.
