## Dependency Graph

```
PR 1 (ranking bug) ──► PR 3 (column sorting)

PR 5 (calendar) ──┐
                   ├──► PR 7 (home layout)
PR 6 (task inbox) ─┘

All others ship independently.
```

## Notes

- PRs 1, 2, 4, 10 are quick wins — ship first for momentum.
- PR 9 (Projects) needs its own planning session — informed by AIJI Project Tracker_v6.xlsx.
- All work happens in `financial_forecasting/frontend/` (React + MUI stack).
- Backend changes needed for PR 6 (task `created_by`, `is_urgent`) and PR 8 (stage history).

## Future Considerations

- **Pipeline Cleanup Tool**: Build a dedicated cleanup/hygiene feature for stale opportunities (past close date or no updates in 30+ days). Removed from Overview dashboard — belongs as its own tool, not on the main dashboard.
