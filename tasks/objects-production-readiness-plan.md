# Objects production-readiness — MVP launch plan

> **⚠️ Superseded 2026-04-21 by updated sequence in `tasks/parallel-pr-lanes.md`.** This doc is preserved as the 2026-04-20 snapshot before Jac's PR #151 (QA polish pack) landed. The 22-PR sequence below is still the scope source of truth for WHAT to ship, but the PR numbers are pre-shift — add **+4** to every queued number (`#149 → #153`, `#150 → #154`, etc.) because `#149, #150, #151, #152` were taken by Jac's QA pack + release rollups. Also a new `#153 pr-singleton-race-fix` inserts at the front of the sequence (see `tasks/pr153-singleton-race-fix-plan.md`). A new `#158 pr-opp-type-deprecation` replaces part of the original `#153 pr-use-schema-picklist` scope (see `tasks/opp-type-full-delete-decision.md`). **Always cross-reference `tasks/parallel-pr-lanes.md` for current numbering and lane assignment.**

**Created:** 2026-04-20
**Status:** PR #147 merged 2026-04-20. PR #148 (page-rename cleanup) open for review; PRs #149-#169 queued below. See live per-PR status in the "PR sequence" table.
**Scope:** The five core Salesforce-backed objects used in daily workflows — **Opportunities, Accounts, Contacts, Tasks, Activities** — brought to production-ready quality for MVP launch.

This plan supersedes B3 (row caps) and B6 (Contacts inline-edit) in `mvp-launch-sprint.md`. Those symptoms roll into PRs #149-#151 below and expand to cover all five objects.

## How to pick this up in a fresh session

1. Read this file top-to-bottom (≈10 min).
2. Find the next queued PR — the lowest-numbered row in the "PR sequence" table whose status column in `jac-running-notes.md` still says `⏳ Queued`.
3. Cut a branch from latest `origin/dev` named `<type>/pr<NNN>-<slug>` (e.g. `fix/pr148-contacts-accounts-pagination`).
4. Execute that PR's scope exactly as specified below. Bundle the `jac-running-notes.md` status-flip + progress-log entry into the same PR diff.
5. Squash-merge on JP approval per standing directive (see `feedback_prefer_prs` memory).

### Numbering note

Predicted PR numbers below assume no unrelated PRs land between ours. If a hotfix or other unrelated PR takes a number from this sequence (e.g. Jac ships #150 as a hotfix), the remaining predicted numbers in this doc shift by one. When that happens, the next planning-bundle PR updates the numbers in this file; the short slug (e.g. `pr-contacts-accounts-pagination`) stays stable so cross-references don't drift.

## Why this plan exists

Two inputs forced the scope expansion from B3:

**2026-04-17 Jac review.** Jac flagged Reports → Opportunities looked row-capped at 500 (perceptual — pageSize + stage filter masking), and Contacts was capped (real — backend uses single-page `query()`). The single-bug frame wasn't sufficient.

**2026-04-20 JP direction.** "We need all the key objects listed here, Opportunities, Accounts, Contacts, Tasks, and Activities (ignore Leads as an object for Reports for MVP). We need edit dialogs to work throughout the site, not just fix the caps on Report page. … We have time to do this correctly, so ignore time constraints. … we need Opportunities, Accounts, Contacts, Tasks, Activities to all work using real SF schemas, not your guesses. This all has to map perfectly to salesforce in order to work. DO NOT DO ANY SHORTCUTS!"

The MVP-daily-use bar: a team member can find, edit, and organize any of the five objects using the real SF schema, from every place those objects surface in the UI.

## Current state — verified directly in source

### Backend list endpoints

| Object | File:line | SF method | Default `limit` | Silent cap |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Opportunities | `financial_forecasting/main.py:304-375` | `query_all()` | `None` | none ✓ |
| Accounts | `financial_forecasting/main.py:470-531` | `query()` | `2000` (`le=2000`) | 2000 ✗ |
| Contacts | `financial_forecasting/main.py:559-611` | `query()` | `2000` (`le=5000`) | 2000 ✗ |
| Tasks — my-tasks | `financial_forecasting/main.py:851-894` | `query()` | `200` (`le=500`) | 200/500 ✗ (scope-bounded by date) |
| Tasks — opp-tasks | `financial_forecasting/main.py:924-970` | `query()` | no SOQL LIMIT | 2000 (SF single-page) ✗ |
| Activities | `financial_forecasting/routes/activities.py:463-538` | Postgres SELECT | `50` (`le=200`) | 200 ✗ |

Opportunities was fixed in commit `4280909` (2026-03-25, PR #68). The same `query() → query_all()` + `limit: Optional[int] = Query(None)` + conditional `LIMIT` clause pattern is what PR #149 propagates to every other SF endpoint.

### Backend write endpoints

| Object | Create | Update | Delete | Request-model field whitelist? |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Opportunities | `main.py:379-399` | `main.py:402-467` | — | no — pass-through `Dict[str, Any]` |
| Accounts | `main.py:534-557` | `main.py:739-761` | — | no — pass-through |
| Contacts | `main.py:614-636` | `main.py:764-786` | — | no — pass-through |
| Tasks | `main.py:973-1002` (per-opp) | `main.py:1004-1041` | `main.py:1044-1066` | **yes** — `TaskCreateRequest`, `TaskUpdateRequest` are typed |
| Activities | `routes/activities.py:545-592` | `routes/activities.py:624-659` | `routes/activities.py:666-684` (soft) | **yes** — `ActivityCreate`, `ActivityUpdate` |

### Frontend list pages

| Page | Object | `pageSize` default | Row-count caption | Columns | Inline edit |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `frontend/src/pages/Opportunities.tsx` | Opportunities | 100 | ✓ hand-rolled line ~529 | mixed `buildPipelineColumns()` + domain cells (Stage/Owner/Account/Amount/Type/Probability/Date) | Stage, Owner, Account, Amount, Type, Probability, Date, Name, CloseDate |
| `frontend/src/pages/Accounts.tsx` | Accounts | 100 | ✗ | `buildSchemaColumns()` + computed metric cols | any `editable: true` field |
| `frontend/src/pages/Contacts.tsx` | Contacts | 100 | ✗ | `buildSchemaColumns()` | schema-driven |
| `frontend/src/pages/Tasks.tsx` | Tasks (current user only) | 100 | ✗ | `buildSchemaColumns()` | schema-driven |
| `frontend/src/pages/Leads.tsx` | Leads (DB-backed, not SF) | 100 | ✗ | schema-driven | — |
| `frontend/src/pages/Activities.tsx` | — | — | — | **does not exist** | — |

Reports.tsx is a tab container that embeds Opportunities, Accounts, Contacts, Leads, Tasks. Per JP's 2026-04-20 direction: Leads drops from Reports for MVP; Activities takes its place.

### Other list surfaces that need the row-count caption

Routing-to-component mapping verified directly in `App.tsx` + `Layout.tsx:72-103`. The 5 MVP nav entries are: **Progress, Priorities, Reports, Projects, Settings**.

| Sidebar label | Route | Renders | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Progress | `/dashboard` | `pages/Progress.tsx` | Per-owner opportunity cards. Wall of Progress feature lives here. |
| Priorities | `/priorities` | `pages/Priorities.tsx` | Renders `PriorityTable` custom component (imported Priorities.tsx:56, used line 1238). |
| Reports | `/reports` | `pages/Reports.tsx` | Tabbed container for Opp/Acct/Contact/Tasks (and Activities post-PR #158). |
| Projects | `/projects` | `pages/Projects.tsx` | |
| Settings | `/settings` | `pages/Settings.tsx` | |

Off-MVP routes that still render lists and need captions:
- `/weekly-priorities` → `pages/WeeklyPriorities.tsx` — separate page, not in MVP nav. Opportunity + task lists.
- `/overview` → redirects to `/dashboard` (legacy alias only).

Surfaces needing `<RowCountCaption>` (PR #151):
- `pages/Priorities.tsx` — `PriorityTable` adapter likely needed to expose visible/total
- `pages/Progress.tsx` (Wall of Progress) — per-owner card headers
- `pages/WeeklyPriorities.tsx` (off-MVP standalone)
- `pages/Accounts.tsx` detail dialog — nested Opportunities grid (rendered at Accounts.tsx:916 area inside the `activeTab < 3` condition)
- Finance pages (`UnpaidBills`, `ReceivedPayments`, `PendingInvoices`, `PaymentProcessing`, `GivingCapacity`, `FinanceDashboard`) — non-SF but user-facing lists (all 6 verified to exist)

### Edit-dialog inventory and critical gaps

| Dialog | File | Editable fields | Schema-driven picklists? | Critical gap |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| OpportunityEditDialog | `frontend/src/components/OpportunityEditDialog.tsx` | 16 | partial (Type only, via `useOpportunityTypePicklist`) | minor: `Earliest_Scheduled_Payment__c` if workflow requires it |
| AccountEditDialog | `frontend/src/components/AccountEditDialog.tsx` | 24 | partial (7 picklists from schema) | minor: `npsp__Matching_Gift_Request_Deadline__c` uses text input, should be date picker |
| ContactEditDialog | `frontend/src/components/ContactEditDialog.tsx` | 26 | partial (5 picklists from schema) | minor: `npe01__AlternateEmail__c` not exposed |
| TaskPanel | `frontend/src/components/TaskPanel.tsx` | 6 | none — all hardcoded | **high: `WhoId` (Contact link) — staff can't link a task to a contact from within Bedrock** |
| ActivityEditDialog | — | — | — | **does not exist — by design per Sprint 9: Activities are mirrored from SF Task/Event; edits flow through the Task/Event CRUD path** |

### Schema infrastructure that already exists

- `utils/schemaColumns.tsx` → `buildSchemaColumns()` — auto-generates MUI DataGrid columns from SF describe output
- `apiService.getSchemaDescribe(sobject)` → `GET /api/salesforce/schema/{sobject}` → live SF describe (audit mode via `?compare=true`)
- `hooks/useOpportunityTypePicklist.ts` — single-field picklist hook (precedent for generalization)

Not yet built, but needed by PRs #153-#157:
- `useSchemaPicklist(sobject, fieldName)` — generalized hook
- Schema-driven dialog builder (post-MVP stretch; dialogs can continue to use hardcoded field lists backed by `useSchemaPicklist` for picklist values)

## PR scope detail

---

### PR #147 — `pr-planning` (this PR)

**Ships:** this file, plus supersession + cross-reference updates on `tasks/jac-running-notes.md`, `tasks/handoff-prompt.md`, `tasks/mvp-launch-sprint.md`, `tasks/accounts-endpoint-pagination-followup.md`, `tasks/sprint9-activities-extension-plan.md`.

**No code.** Unblocks PR #148 onward (page-rename cleanup is the first code PR; without it, every later PR that touches `MyDashboard.tsx` or `Overview.tsx` would reference soon-to-be-stale paths).

---

### PR #148 — `pr-page-rename-cleanup`

**Why now:** verified with `grep` that the two MVP page files have misaligned names. Asymmetry caught during plan verification:

| Sidebar label | Route | Current file | Current component (inside file) | Default export | Target |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Priorities | `/priorities` | `pages/MyDashboard.tsx` | `const MyDashboard` (line 531) | `export default MyDashboard` (line 1511) | `pages/Priorities.tsx` exporting `Priorities` |
| Progress | `/dashboard` | `pages/Overview.tsx` | **`const Progress` (line 79) — already correctly named** | `export default Progress` (line 1083) | `pages/Progress.tsx` exporting `Progress` (file rename only) |

Inbound imports — verified via repo-wide grep, only two:
- `App.tsx:18` — `import Overview from './pages/Overview'` (uses local alias `Overview` even though the default export is `Progress`)
- `App.tsx:22` — `import MyDashboard from './pages/MyDashboard'`

No test files reference either component. Routes (`/priorities`, `/dashboard`) stay unchanged so bookmarks and external links don't break.

**Why ahead of every other code PR:** so subsequent PRs (rowcount captions, dialog audits, etc.) reference the correct, durable file/component names from the start. Doing it later forces a churn pass through every later PR that touched these files.

**Frontend changes:**

For Priorities (asymmetric — file rename + component rename):
- `git mv financial_forecasting/frontend/src/pages/MyDashboard.tsx financial_forecasting/frontend/src/pages/Priorities.tsx`
- Inside `Priorities.tsx`: rename `const MyDashboard: React.FC` → `const Priorities: React.FC` (line ~531). Rename `export default MyDashboard;` → `export default Priorities;` (line ~1511). Search the file for any other `MyDashboard` self-references (JSDoc, displayName, debug strings) and update.
- `App.tsx:22`: `import MyDashboard from './pages/MyDashboard'` → `import Priorities from './pages/Priorities'`. Update the JSX call site at line ~136 (`<MyDashboard />` → `<Priorities />`).

For Progress (file rename only — component is already `Progress`):
- `git mv financial_forecasting/frontend/src/pages/Overview.tsx financial_forecasting/frontend/src/pages/Progress.tsx`
- Inside the file: no rename needed. The component is already declared `const Progress: React.FC` (line 79) and exported `export default Progress` (line 1083).
- `App.tsx:18`: `import Overview from './pages/Overview'` → `import Progress from './pages/Progress'`. Update the JSX call site at line ~146 (`<Overview />` → `<Progress />`).

**Tests + verification:**
- `npx tsc --noEmit` clean (forces compilation across all imports — catches anything we missed).
- `CI=true npm test -- --watchAll=false` no new failures (no test files reference these components by name today, but the test suite imports App so renamed components must compile).
- Manual smoke: nav to `/priorities` and `/dashboard` after the rename; confirm both render the same content as before; verify the page-identity header (rendered by Layout from `currentMenuItem.text`) is unchanged.

**Out of scope:** renaming routes (`/dashboard` → `/progress`) — would break bookmarks. Keep route URLs stable; only file + component names change.

---

### PR #149 — `pr-contacts-accounts-pagination`

**Backend changes — all mirror the Opportunities pattern at `main.py:304-375`:**
- `get_contacts` (`main.py:559-611`): `limit: Optional[int] = Query(None, le=5000)`; conditional `LIMIT`; `salesforce.query_all()`; cache key `f"contacts:{account_id}:{limit or 'all'}"`.
- `get_accounts` (`main.py:470-531`): `limit: Optional[int] = Query(None, le=2000)`; conditional `LIMIT`; `salesforce.query_all()`; cache key `f"accounts:{limit or 'all'}"`.
- `get_opportunity_tasks` (`main.py:924-970`): add `limit: Optional[int] = Query(None, le=2000)`; conditional `LIMIT`; `salesforce.query_all()`. (Currently has no `limit` param and no LIMIT clause — relies on SF's single-page cap.)
- `get_my_tasks` (`main.py:851-894`): default bump 200 → 2000, `le=2000`. **Keep `salesforce.query()`** — verified the endpoint's only mandatory WHERE clause is `IsClosed = false` (`start`/`end` date params are `Optional` and default to `None`). For Pursuit's team-of-4 scale (per-user open Task counts well under 2000), the raised cap is sufficient. **Explicit assumption:** if any single user ever accumulates >2000 unclosed Tasks, this caps silently — switch to `query_all()` in a follow-up. Tracked here so the assumption isn't load-bearing in silence.

**Tests:**
- Update 3 existing `test_get_contacts_*` tests in `tests/test_api_endpoints.py` to mock `query_all` instead of `query`.
- Add `test_get_contacts_paginates_beyond_2000`: mock `query_all` returning 2500 records (list comprehension on `make_sf_contact`), assert response length == 2500, assert SOQL has no `LIMIT` clause.
- Update Accounts + opp-tasks tests similarly.
- Update `tests/conftest.py:mock_salesforce_service` fixture — add `service.query_all = AsyncMock(return_value={"records": []})` so child AsyncMock stubbing doesn't break.

**Verification:** `pytest tests/test_api_endpoints.py -v` no regressions; `npx tsc --noEmit` clean (no FE changes but confirm nothing else broke).

---

### PR #150 — `pr-rowcount-caption-reports-tabs`

**Frontend:**
- New `frontend/src/components/RowCountCaption.tsx` — props `{ visible: number; total: number; label: string; sx?: SxProps }`. Renders e.g. *"Showing 100 of 1,834 opportunities"*. Handles `visible === total` (drops "of Y"); handles `total === undefined` (shows just `visible {label}`).
- Opportunities (`pages/Opportunities.tsx`): migrate the hand-rolled caption at ~line 529 to `<RowCountCaption visible={visibleOpps.length} total={rawOpportunities.length} label="opportunities" />`. Keep the existing summary-stats box next to it.
- Accounts, Contacts, Tasks: add `<RowCountCaption>` above each DataGrid.
- **Skip Leads** — it's being dropped from Reports in PR #158 and has no standalone route (verified: no `/leads` route in `App.tsx`; no `navigate('/leads')` anywhere; the `Leads` component is only mounted via Reports tab 3). Applying a caption there would be wasted work.
- Tests: `RowCountCaption.test.tsx` — render assertions for the three shape variants (equal, different, unknown total).

**Verification:** manual against segundo-db, open each Reports tab, confirm caption matches expected totals.

---

### PR #151 — `pr-rowcount-caption-other-surfaces`

**Frontend:** apply `<RowCountCaption>` (from PR #150) to the remaining list surfaces. After PR #148's page-rename cleanup, references use the new file/component names:
- `pages/Priorities.tsx` (the **Priorities** page, mounted at `/priorities`) — `PriorityTable` custom component, may need a small adapter to expose visible/total counts
- `pages/Progress.tsx` (the **Progress** page, mounted at `/dashboard`) — per-owner card headers
- `pages/WeeklyPriorities.tsx` (separate page at `/weekly-priorities`, not in MVP nav)
- `pages/Accounts.tsx` detail dialog — nested Opportunities grid (rendered at line 916 area inside the `activeTab < 3` condition)
- Finance pages: `UnpaidBills`, `ReceivedPayments`, `PendingInvoices`, `PaymentProcessing`, `GivingCapacity`, `FinanceDashboard`

**Verification:** walk each page in the browser, confirm caption renders correctly.

---

### PR #152 — `pr-tasks-whoid`

**Problem:** TaskPanel hardcodes 6 editable fields. Critical gap: no Contact link — staff have to open Salesforce to link a task to a contact.

**Backend:**
- `TaskCreateRequest` (`main.py:901-908`): add `WhoId: Optional[str] = None`.
- `TaskUpdateRequest` (`main.py:910-917`): add `WhoId: Optional[str] = None`. (Already has `WhatId`.)
- Create/update handlers: pass through `WhoId` when present; `validate_salesforce_id(WhoId, "WhoId")` on set.
- Tests: round-trip WhoId.

**Frontend:**
- `TaskPanel.tsx`: add Contact autocomplete labelled "Contact (Who)". Default options to `apiService.getContacts({ account_id: opportunity.AccountId })`; fall back to unscoped on empty account or typeahead query.
- Display existing `WhoName` in edit mode.
- Tests: component render assertion.

**Intentionally standalone from B4 task-CRUD bug triage (PRs #161-#165).** Adding a data-model field shouldn't block orthogonal bug fixes.

---

### PR #153 — `pr-use-schema-picklist`

> **Numbering update (2026-04-21):** This plan entry's "#153" now maps to actual PR **#156** per the shift table in `tasks/parallel-pr-lanes.md` (A1 landed at #155 first; B1 opened right after). Scope preserved as written below, with one correction in the second bullet — see callout.

**Foundation for PRs #154-#157. No user-visible change.**

- Generalize `frontend/src/hooks/useOpportunityTypePicklist.ts` → `frontend/src/hooks/useSchemaPicklist.ts`. Signature: `useSchemaPicklist(sobject: string, fieldName: string)`. React-query cache keyed on `['schema-picklist', sobject, fieldName]`, 30-min staleTime.
- ~~Retire `useOpportunityTypePicklist` as a thin wrapper: `export const useOpportunityTypePicklist = () => useSchemaPicklist('Opportunity', 'Type');`. Callers unchanged.~~ **Superseded (2026-04-21):** `useOpportunityTypePicklist` is deleted outright by Lane A4 (`pr-opp-type-deprecation`) along with its consumers (`TypeCell.tsx`, inline-edit grid column, `PipelineFilterBar` Type filter, `main.py` Type references). See `tasks/opp-type-full-delete-decision.md` for the full inventory. B1's PR does not touch the old hook — A4 handles deletion cleanly; thin-wrapper path would duplicate A4's work.
- Tests: unit test with mocked `apiService.getSchemaDescribe`.

---

### PR #154 — `pr-dialog-audit-opportunity`

> **Numbering + scope update (2026-04-21):** This plan entry's "#154" maps to actual PR **#159** per the shift table in `tasks/parallel-pr-lanes.md` (A1 #155, B1 #156, A2 #157, A3 #158, B2 #159). **Scope expanded mid-plan** (2026-04-21): bundled with a Payment-navigation feature. **Post-smoke iteration same-day:** an early iteration tried a navigation-link UX (click → `/payment-schedule/:oppId`) but this dead-ended users with no back navigation; replaced with an **inline `<Accordion>` in the Opp dialog's Payment Summary block** — lazy-fetches payments on expand, shows a read-first table, and opens `PaymentEditDialog` as a stacked modal when the user clicks a row's edit icon (so the Opp drawer stays open throughout). Bundling still includes the (separate) `PaymentSchedule.tsx` enhancement since that page is still reachable via stage-transition navigation from Opportunities/Priorities. Surfaced a `FALLBACK_PAYMENT_METHODS`-hardcoded anti-pattern inside `PaymentEditDialog` (violating `feedback_no_demo_versions`) — converted its three picklists (Payment Method, Department, GL Account) to `useSchemaPicklist` as part of the same PR. Bulk-save-overwrite footgun in `routes/payment_schedules.py:132-138` flagged in the PR body + progress log as pre-existing; full fix deferred to a follow-up PR.

Uses `useSchemaPicklist` (PR #153, actual #156).

- Add editable `Earliest_Scheduled_Payment__c` (date picker) inside the Payment Summary block (stage-gated).
- Convert hardcoded `OPPORTUNITY_STAGES` array usage → `useSchemaPicklist('Opportunity', 'StageName')`. If schema fetch fails, render a disabled select with helper text — NOT a hardcoded legacy array. Preserves not-in-list stored values via a disabled `(inactive)` MenuItem per `feedback_sf_stages_sacred`.
- Convert `RenewalRepeat__c` similarly.
- Tests: form-render assertions for each converted field (12 tests in `OpportunityEditDialog.test.tsx`).
- **(Scope expansion, see callout above):** Navigation link → PaymentSchedule page → Edit Details clickthrough → PaymentEditDialog; orphan PaymentEditDialog picklists refactored. 6 tests in new `PaymentEditDialog.test.tsx`, 3 tests in new `PaymentSchedule.test.tsx`.

---

### PR #155 — `pr-dialog-audit-account`

- Convert `npsp__Matching_Gift_Request_Deadline__c` text input → date picker.
- Convert all remaining hardcoded picklist fallback arrays (Type, Account_Tier__c, Industry, AccountSource, Company_Size__c, npsp__Funding_Focus__c, Organization_Focus_Area_s__c) → `useSchemaPicklist` with disabled-select fallback.
- Tests: form-render assertions.

---

### PR #156 — `pr-dialog-audit-contact`

- Add editable `npe01__AlternateEmail__c`.
- Convert hardcoded Salutation fallback + any remaining hardcoded picklists → `useSchemaPicklist`.
- Tests: form-render assertions.

---

### PR #157 — `pr-dialog-audit-taskpanel`

- Convert hardcoded Status array → `useSchemaPicklist('Task', 'Status')`.
- Convert hardcoded Priority array → `useSchemaPicklist('Task', 'Priority')`.
- Tests.

(Does not include adding `WhoId` — that's PR #152, intentionally separate.)

### PR #158 — `pr-activities-list-page`

**Frontend:**
- New `frontend/src/pages/Activities.tsx` — DataGrid list of `bedrock.activity` rows.
  - Uses existing `apiService.getActivities(params)` (already defined at `services/api.ts:595`, returns `ApiResponse<Activity[]>`) with `paginationMode="server"` (the backend endpoint supports `offset`/`limit` natively).
  - Columns hand-built from the `Activity` model (`models.py:169-201`) and `types/activity.ts` — not SF-describe, since Activities are a local bedrock-db object.
  - Filter bar: type (enum), source (enum), activity_date range, entity scope (opportunity/account/contact) — maps to `ActivityFilterParams` already defined.
  - Row click → if `sf_id` set, open related SF Task/Event dialog (edits flow through SF, per Sprint 9 design).
- `pages/Reports.tsx`: drop Leads tab (JP directive), add Activities tab. Update `TAB_MAP` (currently `{ opportunities: 0, accounts: 1, contacts: 2, leads: 3, tasks: 4 }` at Reports.tsx:26-32 → becomes `{ opportunities: 0, accounts: 1, contacts: 2, tasks: 3, activities: 4 }`). Update the `<Tab>` JSX block at lines 91+ accordingly.
- `Layout.tsx:86-90` — update the Reports entry's `subtitle` (currently `'Configurable inline-editable tables for Opportunities, Accounts, Contacts, Leads, and Tasks.'`) → drop "Leads", add "Activities" so it matches the post-PR-158 tab set. Tiny one-line text fix; bundled here because it's caused by the same tab restructure.
- **Leads consequence (verified):** the `Leads` component at `pages/Leads.tsx` has no standalone route in `App.tsx` and no inbound `navigate('/leads')` anywhere in the codebase — it's only reachable via the Reports "Leads" tab. Dropping the tab makes `Leads.tsx` + `contexts/LeadsContext.tsx` dead code. PR #158 leaves the files in place (the `LeadsProvider` still wraps the tree in `App.tsx:112-338`, so removing it is a larger ripple). Actual deletion is an optional post-MVP cleanup PR.
- Apply `<RowCountCaption>` (from PR #150) — totals come from the server via `meta.total` in `ApiResponse`, not client-side array length.

**Note.** The backend CRUD + apiService methods (`getActivities`, `getActivity`, `createActivity`, `updateActivity`, `deleteActivity`, `searchActivities`) are already implemented (`routes/activities.py:463-684` + `services/api.ts:595-606`). PR #158 is frontend list page + Reports tab wiring + Reports subtitle fix only.

**Tests:** Activities page render + filter interaction.

### PR #159 — `pr-activities-sync` (Sprint 9A verification + tests)

**Scope corrected after verification pass 2** (2026-04-20): `data_sync.py::sync_activities()` is substantially **already implemented** at lines 55-162. This PR builds on that foundation; the actual scope is verification + tests, not "completion." Details:
- Reads watermark via `MAX(sf_last_modified) FROM bedrock.activity WHERE source = 'salesforce'` (so the watermark lives in the activity table itself — no separate `bedrock.sync_watermark` table needed).
- Fetches Tasks + Events via `salesforce.query_all` with `LastModifiedDate > {watermark}` WHERE clauses.
- Maps to `bedrock.activity` columns via `_map_sf_task` (data_sync.py:199-250) and `_map_sf_event` (data_sync.py:252-281).
- Upserts via `_upsert_activity` (data_sync.py:283-332) with `WHERE bedrock.activity.deleted_at IS NULL` guard — soft-deleted rows are skipped.
- Wired into `sync_all_data()` at line 340. `/api/activities/sync/trigger` (`routes/activities.py:87-106`) acquires a lock and calls this method in a BackgroundTask.

**What's actually missing:**
- **Round-trip test coverage.** `tests/test_activities.py` has endpoint-level tests (sync_count, sync_trigger, sync_status) but nothing that feeds 3 mock Tasks + 2 mock Events through `sync_activities()` and asserts 5 `bedrock.activity` rows with correctly mapped columns + soft-delete preservation.
- **End-to-end verification against Pursuit's real SF org** — does the sync complete? How long does it take? Are there unexpected record types that fail mapping?
- Any edge-case fixes surfaced by the above.

**Scope for PR #159:**
1. Add `tests/test_activity_sync.py` (or extend `test_activities.py`) — mock SF query_all returning Tasks + Events, run `sync_activities()`, assert bedrock.activity rows. Include cases for: Task with email TaskSubtype → "email" type; Task with CallType → "call"; Event IsAllDayEvent → "calendar-event" vs "meeting"; WhatId → opportunity_id vs account_id routing; soft-deleted row not resurrected.
2. Manual run against segundo-db — trigger sync, check row counts + sync_history.
3. Any edge-case fixes from (1) or (2).

Size bumps from original estimate: if round-trip tests surface real bugs, the fix bundle grows. Split if needed.

### PR #160 — `pr-activities-detail-tabs`

**Frontend:**
- New `frontend/src/components/ActivityTimeline.tsx` — reusable timeline, takes `{ opportunityId?; accountId?; contactId? }`, queries `GET /api/activities/` filtered.
- Wire into Opportunity detail dialog (Activities tab).
- Wire into Account detail dialog — verify the existing Activities tab area around `Accounts.tsx:916`; migrate to shared component.
- Wire into Contact detail dialog (add Activities tab).

Split further if `ActivityTimeline` itself proves non-trivial.

### PR #161 — `pr-b4a-task-title-true`

Fix: task title saved as literal `"True"` instead of entered value. Suspected boolean coercion in `Tasks.tsx`'s `processRowUpdate` or in the TaskPanel save payload. Trace Tasks.tsx → TaskPanel → `updateTask` → backend. Regression test.

---

### PR #162 — `pr-b4b-task-description-400`

Fix: description save returns 400 from backend. Likely request-body shape mismatch against `TaskUpdateRequest`. Trace request payload vs. model. Regression test.

---

### PR #163 — `pr-b4c-task-title-not-persisting`

Fix: title entered on create doesn't land in DB. Separate from B4a (which is a post-save coercion). Trace create flow + TaskCreateRequest handling. Regression test.

---

### PR #164 — `pr-b4d-task-wrong-opportunity`

Fix: task created on one opportunity lands on another. `WhatId` binding at create time is wrong. Trace TaskPanel → `createOpportunityTask` → backend. Regression test.

---

### PR #165 — `pr-b4e-task-delete-no-refresh`

Fix: deleted task still shows on Priorities page. React-query invalidation for the `['my-tasks']` key not firing post-delete. Regression test covering cache invalidation.

### PR #166 — `pr-b5-inline-edit-softening`

From `mvp-launch-sprint.md` B5. Soften the sensitivity gate on Amount + Probability so users don't hit an unlock step. Keep Stage's confirmation dialog. Tests.

---

### PR #167 — `pr-b7-dropdown-position`

From `mvp-launch-sprint.md` B7. Fix MUI Autocomplete/Select popper positioning on inline-edit cells — anchor to the cell, not screen top. Confirm in Chrome, Safari, Firefox.

---

### PR #168 — `pr-b8-progress-full-pipeline`

From `mvp-launch-sprint.md` B8. Jac's argument: managing a pipeline means surfacing losses and withdraws. Add Lost + Withdrawn + Did Not Fulfill to the `PipelineFunnel` / stage-breakdown view.

## Stretch / post-MVP parking lot

- **Schema-driven dialog generator** — `buildSchemaDialog()` analog to `buildSchemaColumns()`. Replaces every hardcoded field list. Large refactor. Defer until MVP is running in production.
- **`useSchemaFields(sobject)` hook** — deferred until a consumer actually needs it (YAGNI).
- **Accounts endpoint performance audit** — if `query_all()` on Accounts introduces latency spikes, move to `paginationMode="server"` at the DataGrid layer.
- **Chrome extension** (Sprint 9B-D per `tasks/sprint9-activities-extension-plan.md`).
- **Playwright click-through tests** (Jac suggestion, 2026-04-17).
- **Post-MVP dialog-stack rework** — JP's modal-stack vs drawer vs tab debate is parked per `mvp-launch-sprint.md:123`.
- **Typed request models for the 3 pass-through create endpoints** — `create_opportunity`, `create_account`, `create_contact` in `main.py` accept `Dict[str, Any]` and forward to SF without field whitelisting (update endpoints wrap payload in `*UpdateRequest` but still pass a raw `updates: Dict[str, Any]` inside). SF's FLS bounds impact in practice, but defense-in-depth would mirror `TaskCreateRequest`'s typed-field pattern across the other 5 handlers. Surfaced during PR #153 verification. **Trigger to promote out of parking lot:** any report of a client posting an unexpected field and SF accepting it, or any multi-tenant expansion beyond Pursuit's team-of-4.
- **Post-MVP MCP client hardening — `_reauth_lock` scope and `health_check` direct-API handling** — surfaced during PR #153 verification. Two small items on the base `UnifiedMCPClient` / `SalesforceMCPService` layer, both benign today but worth polishing later:
  1. `SalesforceMCPService._reauth_lock` is per-instance. The base singleton's service-account path (used by `data_sync`, `forecasting_engine`, `background_sync_task`) shares the lock correctly; per-request wrappers from `_PerRequestMCPClient` each get their own lock. For cookie-path requests the per-instance lock is irrelevant because `_reauthenticate()` fast-fails (no creds), but if we ever give per-request services credentials (e.g. refresh_token-aware re-auth directly from the service), we'd want a shared lock to prevent OAuth-endpoint stampedes. **Trigger:** any plan to move cookie-refresh logic out of `/auth/salesforce/status` and into the SF service layer.
  2. `UnifiedMCPClient.health_check` (`mcp_client/unified_client.py:339-359`) assumes every entry in `_connected_services` has a matching entry in `self.clients`. For direct-API SF (Pursuit's current deployment — no MCP transport), `self.clients["salesforce"]` doesn't exist, so the loop body hits `KeyError` and reports `{"status": "unhealthy", "error": "'salesforce'"}`. The `try/except` catches it so nothing crashes, but the output is cosmetically wrong. No route handler currently calls `health_check` (only `mcp_client/__main__.py` does, outside FastAPI), so no user ever sees this. **Trigger:** any new admin/observability endpoint that exposes health state through FastAPI. Fix is ~10 LOC in the base class — guard `self.clients[service_name]` behind an `in` check, fall back to `service.is_authenticated` when the MCP transport client is absent.
