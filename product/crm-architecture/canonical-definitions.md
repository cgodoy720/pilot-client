## 1. Opportunity Stages (Canonical)

Bedrock uses **one stage enum** for all Opportunities. The `revenue_stream` field (`nonprofit` | `pbc`) determines how the stage is interpreted — not separate stage lists.

| Stage (enum value) | Probability | Nonprofit Interpretation | PBC Interpretation |
|--------------------|------------|--------------------------|-------------------|
| `identified` | 10% | Funder identified, no outreach | Potential partner identified |
| `qualified` | 25% | Intro meeting held, alignment confirmed | Discovery call, needs confirmed |
| `proposal-sent` | 50% | LOI or full proposal submitted | Proposal / SOW delivered |
| `in-negotiation` | 75% | Funder reviewing, Q&A active | Terms being negotiated |
| `verbal-commit` | 90% | Verbal or written intent to fund | Verbal agreement, pending contract |
| `closed-won` | 100% | Award letter received | Contract signed |
| `closed-lost` | 0% | Declined or no response | Deal lost |

### Legacy Stage Mapping (PRD.md → Canonical)

PRD.md (Nov 2025) used ~11 stages that collapsed into 7: Lead Gen/New Lead → `identified`, Qualifying → `qualified`, Design/Proposal Creation → `proposal-sent`, Proposal Negotiation/Contract Creation/Negotiating Contract → `in-negotiation`, Collecting/In Effect/Closed Completed → `closed-won`, Closed Lost/Did not Fulfill → `closed-lost`. Key change: payment state (formerly encoded in Opp stage) now lives in Payment status.

**2026-04-16 update — live SF drift beyond the 11-stage mapping:**
SOQL verified Pursuit's live SF org carries 22 distinct StageName values, not 11. The extra 11 stages and their Bedrock-canonical mapping:

| Live SF stage | Count | Bedrock canonical mapping |
|---|---:|---|
| `In Collection` | 650 | **Not philanthropy** — ISA RecordType (Pursuit Bond / Income Share Agreement), 2019-2020 legacy. Out of scope; handled elsewhere. |
| `Closed Won` | 575 | → `closed-won` (Donorbox-auto-populated donations, money already received via Stripe). `revenue_stream=nonprofit`. |
| `Close/Unknown` | 68 | Dirty data; TBD (cleanup in future Bulk Edit sprint) |
| `Closed / Full-Time or Successful Conversion` | 14 | → `closed-won` with `revenue_stream=pbc` (TBD — fundraising glossary session) |
| `Closed / Temporary Hire` | 5 | → `closed-won` with `revenue_stream=pbc` (TBD) |
| `Closed / Fulfilled` | 5 | TBD (which program?) |
| `Closed / Contract or Agreement But No Fellows Hired` | 4 | Likely → `closed-lost` with `revenue_stream=pbc` (contract signed, zero fellow placements) (TBD) |
| `Contract Signing` | 3 | → `in-negotiation` (late-funnel, pre-close) (TBD) |
| `Closed / Sourcing` | 2 | TBD — misleading name |
| `Verbal Commitment` | 1 | → `verbal-commit` (TBD — pre-contract) |

**Operational fix direction:** Per JP directive 2026-04-16 ("SF stages are sacred"), Bedrock's implementation uses `ReadonlySet<string>` buckets in `frontend/src/types/salesforce.ts` that admit values outside the 7-stage enum. No `LEGACY_STAGES` flag; no stage hiding in edit UIs. When the enum is widened to include PBC stages (deferred post-MVP), all stages appear in dropdowns. See `tasks/f1-stage-buckets-plan.md` (2026-04-16) for the F1 bucket implementation.

## 3. ID Patterns (Canonical)

| Entity | Pattern | Example | Generated By |
|--------|---------|---------|-------------|
| Account | `acct-{slug}` | `acct-goldman-sachs-foundation` | Bedrock (manual/CSV); Salesforce ID stored separately in `salesforce_id` |
| Contact | `contact-{slug}` | `contact-sarah-chen` | Bedrock; slug from `first_name-last_name` |
| Opportunity | `opp-{year}-{nnn}` | `opp-2026-003` | Bedrock; sequential per year |
| Payment | `pay-{year}-{nnn}` | `pay-2026-012` | Bedrock; sequential per year |
| Prospect | `prospect-{year}-{nnn}` | `prospect-2026-042` | Bedrock; sequential per year |
| Task | `task-{year}-{nnn}` | `task-2026-007` | Bedrock |
| Activity | `act-{year}-{nnn}` | `act-2026-015` | Bedrock |
| User | `user-{slug}` | `user-jac-reynolds` | Bedrock / Learning platform |
| GrantRequirements | `grant-req-{opp-id}` | `grant-req-opp-2026-003` | Bedrock; mirrors parent Opportunity ID |
| Decision | `dec-{year}-{nnn}` | `dec-2026-001` | Bedrock |
| NetworkMatch | `match-{contact-slug}-{source}` | `match-sarah-chen-hnwi-2026` | Bedrock |

**Week-1 prototype exception:** The week-1 CSV import uses `prospect-{Date.now()}-{index}` for simplicity (no backend counter). Before production, migrate to sequential `prospect-{year}-{nnn}` IDs with a server-side counter. Do not mix both formats in the same dataset.

### ID Authority Rules

1. **Bedrock generates the canonical ID** for all entities. This is the primary key in all Bedrock storage.
2. **Salesforce IDs are stored as `salesforce_id`** — a secondary reference, not the primary key. This ensures Bedrock can exist independently and migrate to the knowledge graph.
3. **Sage IDs are stored as `sage_id`** on Payment records — a secondary reference for reconciliation.
4. **Slug generation:** lowercase, hyphenated, ASCII-only. `Sarah Chen` → `sarah-chen`. Collision resolution: append sequential number (`sarah-chen-2`).

## 4. Date Definitions

| Term | Definition | Used In |
|------|-----------|---------|
| **"This week"** | Next 7 calendar days from today, inclusive: `[today, today + 6]` — 7 days total. If today is Monday, "this week" = Mon–Sun. | Weekly priorities view, task notifications |
| **"Stale"** (opportunity) | No Activity logged AND no stage change in the last 30 calendar days. Computed on-demand (not a stored field). | Stale detection (F06) |
| **"Stale"** (task) | `due_date < today` AND `status` ∉ {`completed`, `cancelled`}. Computed on-demand. | Task notifications (F13) |
| **"Overdue"** (payment) | `expected_date < today` AND `status` ∉ {`received`, `cancelled`}. Auto-set to `overdue` by nightly job or on sync trigger. | Payment tracking (F28), overdue alerts (F31) |
| **"Concentration risk"** | Any single Account represents >30% of total weighted pipeline. Computed on-demand for dashboard. | Executive dashboard alert (F24) |

## 5. Revenue Stream Enum

| Value | Meaning | Opportunity Types |
|-------|---------|-------------------|
| `nonprofit` | Tax-exempt charitable activity | Grants, donations, in-kind gifts |
| `pbc` | Public Benefit Corporation activity | Consulting, apprenticeship contracts, FDE, sponsorships |

Rules:
- **Required** on every Opportunity. Set at creation, rarely changed.
- **Inherited** by Payments from their parent Opportunity.
- **Not stored** on Accounts — inferred at query time from child Opportunities.
- **Not set** on Contacts, Prospects, Tasks, Activities — these are stream-agnostic.

### Prospect Source

Tracks *how the fundraising opportunity was discovered* — orthogonal to Contact source (which tracks *where the person record came from*). A Contact with source `prospect-list` may become a Prospect with source `network-search-hit` — these are independent facts.

| `event` | Met at an event |
| `cold-outreach` | Proactive outreach with no prior connection |
