## Prioritization Key

| Phase | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| **MVP** | Must ship for Bedrock to be usable. Serves core jobs 1–5 from Scope Constitution. |
| **Post-MVP** | High value but not blocking initial adoption. Ship within 3 months of MVP. |
| **Backlog** | Nice to have. Not scheduled. Requires justification against Scope Constitution to promote. |

## Scope Control Rule

To promote a feature from Backlog to Post-MVP or from Post-MVP to MVP:
1. Map it to a user journey in the Role × Journey Matrix
2. Confirm it serves one of the 5 core jobs in the Scope Constitution
3. Document the dependency chain — what must exist first?
4. Get sign-off from product owner (Jac)

Features that cannot be mapped to a user journey stay on Backlog.
