## Suggested Authoring Order

1. **PRD 01 — Data Model** (foundation; already substantially drafted in `entity-map.md`)
2. **PRD 10 — Weekly Priorities & Tasks** (current week-1 prototype; ship first)
3. **PRD 03 — Opportunity Management** (core pipeline; most features depend on this)
4. **PRD 02 — Account & Contact Management** (prerequisite for Opportunities)
5. **PRD 09 — Salesforce Migration & Sync** (unblocks real data)
6. **PRD 06 — Reporting & Cash Flow** (CEO visibility — high-value)
7. **PRD 08 — User Roles & Permissions** (needed before multi-user rollout)
8. **PRD 12 — Activity & Interaction Logging** (manual logging is MVP; Slack is post-MVP)
9. **PRD 04 — Payments & Revenue Tracking** (Phase 2 gated on Sage)
10. **PRD 07 — Sage Integration** (Phase 2)
11. **PRD 05 — Campaign Management** (post-MVP)
12. **PRD 11 — Prospect Intelligence** (post-MVP)
