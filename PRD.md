# Pursuit Grants Management Platform PRD

**Project:** Grants Management Platform (Phase 1: Partnerships Pipeline)  
**Owner:** Jac  
**Date:** November 9, 2025  
**Last Updated:** November 9, 2025

## Problem

Pursuit's grant management and finance systems are disconnected, resulting in poor data quality and limited financial visibility. The partnerships team doesn't maintain an accurate pipeline in Salesforce—close dates routinely slip by months and confidence levels are unreliable. For closed grants, there's no systematized way to track which payments have actually been received.

The bookkeeper operates in a silo, manually creating invoices based on word-of-mouth information with no connection to Salesforce records. Finance data exists as a black box, accessible only through ad-hoc manual updates. The partnerships team lacks trustworthy finance data, while the bookkeeper has no reliable pipeline projections or payment schedules.

Salesforce and Sage Intacct operate as completely separate systems with no integration. This disconnect forces the finance and partnerships teams to collectively spend over 80 hours per month manually tracking and forecasting cash flows. Millions of dollars in outstanding revenue remain untracked in any organized way. The new CEO cannot get reliable visibility into the organization's financial state.

**Supporting Context:**
- Finance and partnerships teams collectively spend over 80 hours per month tracking and attempting to forecast cash flows
- Millions of dollars of outstanding revenue are not being tracked in an organized way
- New CEO needs immediate visibility into financial state but cannot get it with current systems

---

## Opportunity

Enable Pursuit's CEO and leadership to have real-time visibility into the organization's financial pipeline and cash flow projections, while reducing manual data entry burden on partnerships and finance teams.

## Users & Needs

### Primary users:
- 4 Partnerships ICs managing grant opportunities
- 1 Bookkeeper managing invoicing and payments (Phase 2)
- CEO monitoring financial state

### Secondary users:
- Potentially other executives/leadership who need pipeline visibility

### Key user needs:

#### Partnerships ICs:
- As a partnerships IC, I need to quickly create and update grant opportunities without navigating Salesforce's complex UI, because the current system is too cumbersome and discourages regular updates
- As a partnerships IC, I need to see all my opportunities and my team's pipeline in one place, because I need context on our overall capacity and relationships with funders
- As a partnerships IC, I need to be reminded when opportunities are stale or close dates are approaching, because it's easy to lose track across multiple active grants
- As a partnerships IC, I need to track payment schedules for multi-year grants, because funders have different payment structures and I need to set accurate expectations

#### CEO:
- As CEO, I need real-time visibility into total pipeline value and weighted projections, because I need to understand our financial runway and make strategic decisions
- As CEO, I need to see projected cash flow by quarter, because I need to plan organizational capacity and hiring
- As CEO, I need to drill into individual deals when needed, because high-level metrics sometimes require investigating specific opportunities

#### Bookkeeper (Phase 2):
- As a bookkeeper, I need to create invoices that are automatically linked to Salesforce opportunities, because manual invoice creation from word-of-mouth leads to errors and disconnected data
- As a bookkeeper, I need to track which payments have been received against the expected payment schedule, because I need to know what's outstanding and what's overdue

## Proposed Solution

Build a custom AI-powered grants management platform that sits on top of Salesforce and Sage Intacct, providing a simplified interface for partnerships team to manage their pipeline and for finance to track payments. The platform eliminates the need to directly use Salesforce's complex UI by offering a purpose-built experience with only essential fields, AI-assisted data entry for payment schedules, and automatic real-time syncing to both systems. An executive dashboard provides the CEO with live visibility into pipeline value, cash flow projections, and deal health metrics. Phase 1 focuses on partnerships pipeline management, with Phase 2 adding bookkeeper invoicing and payment tracking once Sage Intacct integration is available.

### Top 3 MVP Value Props:

**[The Vitamin] - The must-have that maintains status quo**  
Real-time pipeline visibility and cash flow forecasting that replaces 80 hours/month of manual tracking, ensuring CEO always has current financial state

**[The Painkiller] - Solves the biggest pain point**  
Simple, purpose-built UI with only 9 essential opportunity fields (vs 50+ in Salesforce) and AI-assisted payment schedule entry, eliminating the friction that prevents partnerships team from keeping data current

**[The Steroid] - The magic moment that delights**  
Automatic context aggregation from across Pursuit's systems (Slack notifications, Gmail threads, Fireflies meeting transcripts, Google Drive documents) that surfaces in one place, so partnerships never has to hunt for information or manually log updates

## User Journey 3: CEO - Understanding Financial State

**Context:** CEO needs immediate visibility into the organization's financial position without relying on manual reports from finance or partnerships. Executive dashboard must provide both high-level metrics and ability to drill into deal details.

### Executive Dashboard - High-Level Metrics

**Note:** "Open pipeline" refers only to opportunities in active pursuit stages: Lead Gen, New Lead, Qualifying, Design / Proposal Creation, Proposal Negotiation, Contract Creation, and Negotiating Contract. Closed won, collecting, and closed lost opportunities are excluded from pipeline calculations.

  - [x] Total $ amount in each stage
  - [x] Weighted $ amount in each stage (factored by probability)

  - [x] Expected close dates
  - [x] Payment schedules
  - [x] Probability-weighted amounts
- [x] **[P0]** CEO can view projected cash flow by year

## User Journey 4: Bookkeeper - Managing Invoicing and Payment Tracking (Phase 2)

**Context:** Once Sage Intacct developer license is available, the bookkeeper needs to create invoices tied to closed grant opportunities and track which payments have actually been received. This eliminates manual invoice creation via word-of-mouth and connects finance data back to the Salesforce pipeline.

### Invoice Creation

- [ ] **[P1]** Bookkeeper can view all opportunities in "Collecting / In Effect" stage that need invoicing
- [ ] **[P1]** Bookkeeper can create an invoice in Sage Intacct directly from an opportunity
- [ ] **[P1]** Invoice automatically pulls data from opportunity:
  - [ ] Account name (bill to)
  - [ ] Primary contact information
  - [ ] Total amount
  - [ ] Payment schedule breakdown
- [ ] **[P1]** Invoice is automatically linked back to the Salesforce opportunity record
- [ ] **[P1]** Bookkeeper can edit invoice details before finalizing in Sage Intacct
- [ ] **[P1]** System validates that invoice total matches opportunity amount

### Payment Tracking

- [ ] **[P1]** Bookkeeper can view all expected payments from payment schedules across all opportunities in "Collecting / In Effect" stage
- [ ] **[P1]** Bookkeeper can mark individual payments as "Received" when payment comes in
- [ ] **[P1]** When payment is marked as received in platform, it updates:
  - [ ] Payment schedule status in Salesforce
  - [ ] Associated invoice status in Sage Intacct
- [ ] **[P1]** Bookkeeper can view overdue payments (expected payment date has passed but not marked as received)
- [ ] **[P1]** Bookkeeper receives notification for payments that are 7+ days overdue
- [ ] **[P1]** Payment status updates sync to both Salesforce and Sage Intacct in real-time

### Payment Dashboard

- [ ] **[P1]** Bookkeeper can view dashboard showing:
  - [ ] Total outstanding receivables (expected but not received)
  - [ ] Payments received this month vs expected
  - [ ] Overdue payments by account
  - [ ] Upcoming payments in next 30 days
- [ ] **[P1]** Bookkeeper can filter payment view by:
  - [ ] Account
  - [ ] Date range
  - [ ] Status (Expected/Received/Overdue)
- [ ] **[P1]** CEO has read-only access to bookkeeper's payment dashboard for cash flow visibility
