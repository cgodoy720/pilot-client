"""Bedrock intake API — bug/feature submission endpoint.

Writes rows into `public.pd_tickets`, the canonical Pursuit Product
Development ticket table. The older `public.platform_intake` capture
table is deprecated; Pursuit now uses `pd_tickets` directly for every
product surface, Bedrock (Revenue Hub) included.

Submissions from this app are tagged with:
    * `source = 'bedrock'` — partitions Bedrock rows from the existing
      `source='app'` traffic coming from the Pursuit learning platform.
    * `surface_id = BEDROCK_SURFACE_ID` — points at the single
      `pd_surface_registry` row registered for the Bedrock CRM
      (product_area: 'Revenue Hub'). The fine-grained component the
      reporter picked in the form (priorities / accounts / tasks / ...)
      is preserved as a `**Component:** ...` header at the top of the
      ticket `description`, which keeps the field visible on the ticket
      without polluting the shared surface registry with 10 bedrock-
      specific rows.

Key allocation:
    `pd_tickets.key_number` has no sequence or trigger — the Pursuit
    app allocates it client-side. We do the same, but wrap the MAX+1
    read and the INSERT in a single transaction protected by a
    Postgres advisory lock (`pg_advisory_xact_lock`) so concurrent
    submissions can't produce duplicate keys. Under real traffic the
    lock is effectively uncontended, so the cost is negligible.

Auth: any logged-in user (no permission check). Reporter email comes
from the session cookie (`user["email"]`) — the form's reporter_name
field is a display-only convenience that can be overridden
client-side but is never trusted server-side.
