# Financial Forecasting Solution for Pursuit

A comprehensive financial forecasting system that bridges the gap between Salesforce (sales pipeline) and Sage Intacct (accounting/finance), providing real-time visibility into grant opportunities, payment forecasting, and cash flow projections.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

**Challenge:**
- Development/fundraising team tracks grant opportunities in Salesforce
- Finance team has no insight into when payments will arrive
- Sales team doesn't know when payments hit or invoicing status  
- Salesforce UI is complex and difficult to use for quick updates
- No visibility into cash flow projections based on pipeline probability

**Solution:**
This POC provides a simplified dashboard where:
- ✅ Development team can easily edit Salesforce opportunities (better UX than Salesforce)
- ✅ Finance team can see when payments are expected based on close dates and probability
- ✅ Automated forecasting combines sales pipeline with payment timing
- ✅ Finance can initiate invoicing workflows based on Salesforce milestone completion
- ✅ Real-time sync between Salesforce and Sage Intacct

## 📊 Current Data (Your Pursuit Org)

**Connected Salesforce Org:** joinpursuit.my.salesforce.com

> **Note (2026-04-16):** The pipeline snapshot below is POC-era sample data from Nov 2025. The live Pursuit SF org has ~6,000+ Opportunities across **22 distinct stages** (13 declared in the enum; 9 drift stages documented in `../tasks/stage-schema-drift.md`). Current live queries + funnel classifier work on real data — see `frontend/src/pages/Progress.tsx` and `routes/ai.py`.

**Pipeline Overview (POC snapshot, Nov 2025):**
- **50 grant opportunities** in pipeline
- **$35.4M total pipeline value**
- **$814K weighted expected revenue** (probability-adjusted)
- **Major funders:** Google, Amazon, PNC, Apollo, Pivotal Ventures, and more

**Sample Opportunities (POC, Nov 2025):**
- Google SMB Expansion - $300K (28% probability)
- Apollo Opportunity Foundation - $1M (5% probability)
- Black Family Philanthropies Campaign - $4M
- PNC Financial - $100K (17% probability)

### 5. **Invoice Automation** (Pending Sage Intacct connection)
- Automatically trigger invoice creation when grants are won
- Map Salesforce opportunities to Sage Intacct invoices
- Track payment status and sync back to Salesforce
- Alert finance team when invoices are overdue

## 🔧 Setup & Configuration

**→ See [DEV_SETUP_GUIDE.md](DEV_SETUP_GUIDE.md)** for step-by-step setup, env vars, and run instructions.

**Prerequisites:** Python 3.8+, Node.js 16+, Salesforce API access, Sage Intacct credentials (optional for POC).

## 📱 User Workflows

### For Development/Fundraising Team:
1. **View Pipeline:** See all opportunities in a clean dashboard
2. **Quick Edit:** Click any opportunity to update:
   - Stage (Qualifying, Proposal, Negotiation, etc.)
   - Amount
   - Probability
   - Close date
   - Next steps
3. **Track Progress:** Visual pipeline with stages and amounts
4. **Updates sync:** All changes automatically save to Salesforce

### For Finance Team:
1. **Payment Forecast:** See when money is expected to arrive
2. **Cash Flow View:** Monthly projections for planning
3. **Invoice Triggers:** Get notified when grants close to initiate invoicing
4. **Payment Tracking:** See which invoices are paid/pending
5. **Risk Alerts:** Identify overdue payments and at-risk opportunities

## 🎨 Dashboard Features

### Main Dashboard
- **Pipeline Overview:** Total value, weighted value, number of opportunities
- **Cash Flow Chart:** 6-month projection of expected receipts
- **Top Opportunities:** Sorted by expected value (amount × probability)
- **Recent Activity:** Latest updates and stage changes
- **Risk Indicators:** At-risk opportunities, overdue items

### Opportunities Page
- **Interactive Grid:** Sortable, filterable list of all opportunities
- **Quick Edit:** Click to edit any field inline
- **Stage Pipeline:** Visual representation of pipeline stages
- **Bulk Actions:** Update multiple opportunities at once
- **Export:** Download to Excel/CSV

### Cash Flow Page
- **Monthly Projections:** Expected receipts by month
- **Scenario Analysis:** Optimistic, realistic, pessimistic views
- **Payment Timeline:** When each opportunity is expected to pay
- **Historical Comparison:** Actual vs. projected

### Invoices Page (When Intacct connected)
- **Invoice Status:** All invoices with payment status
- **Create Invoice:** Generate invoice from won opportunity
- **Payment Tracking:** See which payments have been received
- **Aging Report:** Overdue invoices and collection priorities

## 🔮 Forecasting Logic

### Payment Date Calculation
```python
expected_payment_date = close_date + payment_terms_days + average_delay
```

### Probability Adjustment
```python
adjusted_probability = (
    stated_probability * 0.7 +
    stage_based_probability * 0.3
) * historical_account_win_rate * deal_size_factor
```

### Risk Factors
- Overdue close dates
- Early stage with near-term close
- Large deal amounts (>$100K)
- Low historical win rate for funder
- Extended payment terms (>60 days)

### Cash Flow Confidence
```python
confidence = weighted_avg_probability * forecast_count_adjustment
```

## 📊 API Endpoints

- ⚠️ Credentials visible in config.py

### Production Recommendations
1. **Environment Variables:** Move credentials to `.env` file
2. **API Authentication:** Add JWT tokens or OAuth
3. **User Roles:** Implement role-based access control
4. **Audit Logging:** Track all data changes
5. **HTTPS:** Use SSL certificates for all API calls
