"""Awards service — manages bedrock.award rows.

Award is a thin lifecycle entity layered over closed Opportunities across
Philanthropy, PBC, Debt/Equity, and Other Fee For Service record types.
Salesforce stays SoT for the Opportunity itself; this service owns only the
post-award lifecycle bits (status, period, notes) that don't belong on the
Opportunity record.

See `tasks/bedrock-redesign-data-model.md` for the full plan.

Public surface:
    - `is_award_eligible(stage_name, record_type_name)` — pure predicate
    - `ensure_for_opp(conn, sf_client, opp_id)` — idempotent auto-create
    - `get_for_opp(conn, opp_id)` — fetch by SF opp id
