/**
 * Stage helpers — no display mapping (StageChip shows the literal SF
 * StageName). For categorization, "won" is defined as **stages that
 * produce a bedrock.award row**. That's the same predicate used in
 * services/awards_service.py (ELIGIBLE_STAGES_BY_RECORD_TYPE), unioned
 * across all eligible record types so we can run the check in the
 * frontend without a per-row API call.
 *
 * Why not just `IsClosed && IsWon`? Pursuit's SF picklist has stages
 * like "Collecting / In Effect" and "Closed / Did not Fulfill" that
 * **do** produce awards but don't necessarily flip SF's `IsWon` flag
 * (or are even closed yet). The award-eligibility set is the single
 * source of truth for "this opp counts as won."
