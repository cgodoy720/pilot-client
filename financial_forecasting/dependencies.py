    """Request-scoped wrapper that overrides the Salesforce slot with a
    per-request service built from the caller's ``sf_tokens`` cookie.

    Fixes the singleton race where concurrent requests from different users
    would mutate ``base.services["salesforce"]`` in place and leak
    ``sf_client`` references across threads — User A's in-flight SOQL
    could execute against User B's session after a cookie swap, because
    ``SalesforceMCPService`` CRUD methods capture ``self`` (not
    ``self.sf_client`` by value) in the ``run_in_executor`` lambda.

    Intentionally does NOT call ``super().__init__()`` — that would reset
    the base class's services/clients/connected dicts. Instead we
    shallow-copy the base's three state containers at wrap time so any
    mutation a route handler might perform on ``self.services``,
    ``self.clients``, or ``self._connected_services`` stays request-scoped
    and never leaks back to the base singleton.

    The ``MCPClient`` and ``SalesforceMCPService`` instances inside those
    containers are still shared references — the isolation guarantee is at
    the container level (dict/list), not at the object level. For the SF
    slot specifically we swap in a per-request ``SalesforceMCPService``
    below, so SF CRUD on a wrapper touches no objects shared with the base
    singleton.

    All ``@property`` accessors on ``UnifiedMCPClient`` (``.salesforce``,
    ``.connected_services``, ``.get_service``, the other typed accessors)
    work unchanged because they read from the instance attributes this
    ``__init__`` populates.
