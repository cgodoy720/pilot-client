## Workflow Orchestration

### 1. Plan Mode Default
- Enter plan mode for ANY non-trivial task (3+ steps or architectural decisions)
- This includes UI changes — plan and ask clarifying questions before building
- If something goes sideways, STOP and re-plan immediately - don't keep pushing
- Use plan mode for verification steps, not just building
- Write detailed specs upfront to reduce ambiguity

### 2. Subagent Strategy
- Use subagents liberally to keep main context window clean
- Offload research, exploration, and parallel analysis to subagents
- For complex problems, throw more compute at it via subagents
- One task per subagent for focused execution

### 2a. Agent Teams (Local Setup)
- 10 custom agents in `.claude/agents/` — local only, not committed to repo
- All agents use Opus; `model: opus` resolves to latest Opus at Claude Code runtime
- Invoke via `@agent-name` mention or natural language; `/agents` for management only
- Agents cannot spawn other agents — main thread orchestrates the workflow

> **Pebble disambiguation:** "Agent Teams" here = Claude Code development agents
> (scout, architect, backend, etc.). These are NOT Pebble's research agents
> (Worker/Drone/Forager/Queen bee hierarchy in `pebble/`). Completely separate systems.

#### Read-Only Agents (permissionMode: plan)
- `scout` — Code explorer & explainer. Trace data flow, explain behavior.
- `architect` — System designer. Feature design, migration planning, trade-offs.
- `reviewer` — Quality gate. Security, patterns, tests, canonical correctness.
- `integration-debugger` — Diagnose external API issues (Salesforce, Sage, Slack).

#### Implementation Agents
- `backend` — Python/FastAPI. Endpoints, models, business logic, MCP services.
- `frontend` — React/TypeScript/MUI. Pages, components, hooks, service calls.
- `tester` — pytest + Jest. Test writing, running, verification.
- `data-modeler` — Schema design, migrations, canonical validation, PostgreSQL planning.
- `pebble-dev` — Pebble AI pipeline. Data sources, prompt templates, orchestrator stages.
- `docs` — PRDs, architecture docs, setup guides, PLAN-INDEX, lessons.md.

#### Workflows

**Building**
1. Feature Build: `scout → architect → [data-modeler] → backend + frontend → tester → reviewer`
2. Pebble Extension: `architect → pebble-dev → tester → reviewer`
3. Schema Migration: `architect → data-modeler → backend → tester → reviewer`

**Fixing**
4. Bug Fix: `scout → backend/frontend → tester → reviewer`
5. Integration Fix: `integration-debugger → [scout] → backend → tester`
6. Incident Response: `integration-debugger → backend → tester` (review post-fix)

**Understanding**
7. Spike / Research: `scout → architect` (no implementation)

**Maintaining**
8. Docs Sprint: `scout → docs`
9. Pre-Commit Review: `reviewer` (standalone)

### 3. Self-Improvement Loop
- After ANY correction from the user: update `tasks/lessons.md` with the pattern
- Write rules for yourself that prevent the same mistake
- Ruthlessly iterate on these lessons until mistake rate drops
- Review lessons at session start for relevant project

### 4. Verification Before Done
- Never mark a task complete without proving it works
- Diff behavior between main and your changes when relevant
- Ask yourself: "Would a staff engineer approve this?"
- Run tests, check logs, demonstrate correctness

### 5. Demand Elegance (Balanced)
- For non-trivial changes: pause and ask "is there a more elegant way?"
- If a fix feels hacky: "Knowing everything I know now, implement the elegant solution"
- Skip this for simple, obvious fixes - don't over-engineer
- Challenge your own work before presenting it

### 6. Autonomous Bug Fixing
- When given a bug report: just fix it. Don't ask for hand-holding
- Point at logs, errors, failing tests - then resolve them
- Zero context switching required from the user
- Go fix failing CI tests without being told how

## Task Management

1. **Plan First**: Write plan to `tasks/todo.md` with checkable items
2. **Verify Plan**: Check in before starting implementation
3. **Track Progress**: Mark items complete as you go
4. **Explain Changes**: High-level summary at each step
5. **Document Results**: Add review section to `tasks/todo.md`
6. **Capture Lessons**: Update `tasks/lessons.md` after corrections

## Core Principles

- **Simplicity First**: Make every change as simple as possible. Impact minimal code.
- **No Laziness**: Find root causes. No temporary fixes. Senior developer standards.
- **No Demo Versions**: Build production-ready from the start. When tempted to hardcode, gate behind flags, or build "for now" shortcuts, push back and clarify the production approach instead. Only build a demo version if explicitly confirmed twice.
- **Minimal Impact**: Changes should only touch what's necessary. Avoid introducing bugs.

## Target Platform Compatibility

This project will integrate into the Pursuit AI-native learning platform. Keep these stack and pattern choices in mind:

- **Target stack**: React 19 + Vite + Tailwind + shadcn/ui | Node.js + Express | PostgreSQL + pgvector
- **Auth**: JWT (via `authenticateToken` middleware), tokens in localStorage, `Authorization: Bearer` header
- **API pattern**: REST `/api/{resource}`, JSON errors `{error, details?}`, standard HTTP status codes
- **Frontend conventions**: `fetchWithAuth` utility, pages in `src/pages/`, shared components in `src/components/`, context providers in `src/context/`
- **DB**: PostgreSQL with `db.one()`, `db.any()`, `db.none()` query helpers
- **Infra**: Google Cloud (Storage, BigQuery, Cloud Run), OpenRouter for LLM calls
- **User roles to anticipate**: `builder`, `staff`, `admin`, `applicant`, `volunteer`, `enterprise_admin`
- When making architectural choices, prefer patterns that port cleanly to this stack
